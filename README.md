# .NET-Angular-Messaging-App
A messaging app developed using .NET and Angular

It was originally named DatingApp, and as such, results the difference in naming amongst the file names and code. The UserInterface should be fine however.

User "ng serve --open" to run the Angular application, and run it on http://localhost:4200/.

Use "dotnet run" or "dotnet watch run" to run the server side .NET Core application.

The application has been seeded with data using https://www.json-generator.com/, and it is reseeded every time the .NET application runs, unless data already exists in the database. And as such, the database may be dropped without any impairments to the function of the application.
